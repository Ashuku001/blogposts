## My Roommate has gone mad
When reality catches up l'm not kind.
Kindness is a choice we can make even when faced with tough times. Practicing empathy, understanding and compassion are all acts of kindness.Encountering stressors, however challanges our ability to remain kind.

Sat on my bed, deeply concentrated on a book l'm suddenly interrupted by loud banging of the front door. Adjusting from my slant position to an upright l try to contemplate the moment.Oooh it's my furious roommate. 

Slowly in my flipflops,l join her in the living room.Her face red,clenched fists invite an intense and intimidating presence.The room is clouded by a severe mood. Without a word, l knw what this ia all about. 

Earlier her bestfriend had showed up wanting to shop from our monthly stock, contrary to my usual  kindness this time she's served with a cold NO.Why hold a  parasitic relationship. I just didnâ€™t knw the right time to adress it. This particular day l felt confident to.Faced with hard economic times,it was time to,esp when the second parties contribution is nearly null.

Waking up in a pool of blood, my legs bleeding profusely from a knife cut. I manage to crawl to the store. Gasoline is now all over the place and l drop the lighter. The house is set ablaze. Walking across the streets, l hear sirens nd screams.My vision is getting blurry. Behind me is smoke and flames. I am not kind. It's getting dark here....l feel my body gravitating towards the ground.
