What's your ideal man? . That is one of the questions I don’t answer to all my all potentials. If pushed, i tread carefully on my choice of words or simply l give the basics; tall,handsome, caring and if l stretch, a thinker!

Living in a world where everything seems elevetated and well-intetioned ‘preys' pick it as a better moment to play the ideal lover. We are often drawn to things that we feel we lack. Seeing these missing moments cast to us by our ideals makes us fall in love. Isn’t it why they are our ideals? They have the ability to resurface our ideals that lurked underneath waiting to be sparked.

Simply they trigger us and we project to them our deepest desires. They disguise their manipulation behind the facade of an ideal, a sense of absolute devotion being the key.

As time elapses our energy is sapped in trying to keep them around.why? We can’t do without them.We are drowned in the fantasy.Coming out of it is an emotional torture. We go to insane extents to have them, but wasn’t that the very aim of “what’s your ideal?” from the very beginning?

When it now dawns to you , you are emotionally reaped. Emotionally reaped? That’s way too modest, you are heartbroken! Mentally you are unstable! Sent to bitter tears,lose of appetite;that doesn’t apply to me though you fall into depression.

All these, from a simple hello to deep depression!
If only you had ignored “what’s your ideal person”
